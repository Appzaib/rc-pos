# RC-PoS
```php
  $this->extends theme.(startbootstrap-sb-admin);
```

### Description
RC-PoS is a popular open source web application for point of sale systems. It is a responsive HTML template that is based on the CSS framework Bootstrap 4. It utilizes all of the Bootstrap components in its design and re-styles many commonly used plugins to create a consistent design that can be used as a user interface for backend applications. This template is based on a modular design, which allows it to be easily customized and built upon.


### Dependencies
RC-PoS depends on two main frameworks and libraries. The downloadable package contains these libraries, so you don't have to manually download them.
* Bootstrap *4.1.3*
* Font Awesome *4.7.0*
* JQuery *3.3.1*
* Popper.js *1.14.4*

### Browser Support
RC-POS supports the following browsers:
* IE9+
* FireFox (latest)
* Safari (latest)
* Chrome (latest)
* Opera (latest)
*Note: IE9 does not support transitions or animations. The template will function properly but it won't use animations/transitions on IE9.*
